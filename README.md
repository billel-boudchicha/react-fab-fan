### React Fab Fan

[Live example!](https://react-fab-fan-fjgjrwnngi.now.sh)  
(the example might need to wake up, which will take ~10-15 seconds)


This is an example of a react-motion floating action button fan I wrote for an internal project.
The code is relatively easy to look at, and the `<FabFan />` component can just take more/less buttons as props.
